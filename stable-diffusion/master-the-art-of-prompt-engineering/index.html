                In my previous article titled “Demystifying Stable Diffusion”, I mentioned that prompt engineering was a
                major challenge of Stable Diffusion because generating precise images requires carefully crafting text
                prompts. In this article, I address this challenge by providing techniques for writing better prompts,
                thus creating outstanding images. First, I&apos;ll describe the elements of great prompts and the key
                techniques for writing them. Second, I&apos;ll describe different types of prompts that can be used in
                different image generation scenarios. Finally, I&apos;ll provide a general prompt writing recipe that is
                guaranteed to consistently generate outstanding AI images.

                All About Prompt Engineering
            </h2>
            <p>
                Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective text prompts to guide an AI
                model&mdash;such
                as Stable Diffusion&mdash;to generate a desired image. It involves choosing the right words, structure,
                and
                level of detail to clearly communicate a creative intent to the model.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prompt engineering is extremely
                important because better prompts result in better images. In fact, even small changes in wording can
                lead to very different results. So it is crucial to master the art of prompt engineering in order to
                create outstanding AI art. And the first step to doing so is to learn the key elements of a good prompt.
            </p>

            <h2 class="typography-headline-super">
                The Elements of a Good Prompt
            </h2>
            <p>
                What makes a good prompt? The first element of a good prompt is clarity. Be specific, not vague. For
                instance, instead of writing <em class="prompt">“a woman”</em>, write <em class="prompt">“a young Asian
                    woman with long hair”</em>. The images below,
                generated using both prompts, clearly illustrate this point.
            </p>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/prompt-a-woman.jpg" alt="A woman" />
                <figcaption>A woman</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/prompt-a-young-asian-woman.png" alt="A young Asian woman with long hair" />
                <figcaption>A young Asian woman with long hair</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The differences in the images are quite clear. With the first prompt, we get images of women of
                different races, ages, and hair styles. With the second prompt, all the women are Asian, young, and with
                long hair.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second element of a good prompt is the use of descriptive adjectives for colors, moods, lighting,
                and art styles to enhance the prompt. For colors, clearly state the color (<i>“red“</i>, <i>“white”</i>.
                etc). For
                mood, use words such as <i>“moody atmosphere”</i>, or <i>“foggy morning”</i>. For lighting, use words
                such as
                <i>“cinematic lighting”</i>, <i>“studio lighting”</i>, or <i>“in morning light”</i>. And for art styles,
                use words such as
                <i>“digital painting”</i>, or <i>“in the style of [artist]”</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Putting all these elements together, we can write an effective prompt such as the following: <em
                    class="prompt">“A young
                    woman with long hair walking on the beach, wearing a red dress, in morning light,
                    photorealistic”</em>. This
                prompt would generate the following image.
            </p>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/young-woman-red-dress-walking-on-beach.png" alt="A woman walking on the beach" />
                <figcaption>A young woman with long hair walking on the beach, wearing a red dress, in morning light,
                    photorealistic</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The elements that I have outlined here are still generic. To be more specific, they need to be put in
                the context of a given type of prompt. In fact, there are different types of prompts, each with its own
                set of minimal elements and attributes. The most widely used types of prompts are keyword-based prompts,
                description-based prompts, style-based prompts, and parameterized prompts. The following sections
                describe each type in more detail.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Section: Keyword-based prompts -->

            <h2 class="typography-headline-super">
                Keyword-Based Prompts: Good for Anime
            </h2>
            <p>
                Keyword-based prompts are short, comma-separated tags similar to DeepBooru or DanBooru tags, which are
                Japanese tagging systems used for generating anime images. Keyword-based prompts work well with
                anime-style models and models trained on tag-based datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following is an example of a keyword-based prompt: <em class="prompt">“1girl, long hair, school
                    uniform, looking at viewer, cherry blossom, detailed eyes”</em>. Such a prompt would generate an
                image similar to the one below.
            </p>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/1girl-long-hair-school-uniform.png" alt="1girl, long hair, school uniform" />
                <figcaption>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Keyword-based prompts are highly efficient and they work well with tag-trained models. However, they are
                less expressive; so they are not great for complex compositions or for photorealism.
            </p>

                Description-Based Prompts: A Natural Language Style
            </h2>
            <p>
                Description-based prompts use sentences and paragraphs that describe a scene. They are often written
                like a story or caption. They are ideal for models that were trained on natural language, such as
                CLIP-based models.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of a description-based prompt would be as follows: <em class="prompt">“A young woman with
                    long black hair walks
                    through a cherry blossom park, wearing a Japanese school uniform, as petals fall around her”</em>.
                This would
                generate an image similar to the one below.
            </p>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/young-girl-in-uniform-walking-petals.png"
                    alt="A young woman with long black hair walks through a cherry blossom park" />
                <figcaption>
                    A young woman with long black hair walks through a cherry blossom park, wearing a Japanese school
                    uniform, as petals fall around her
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Description-based prompts are more expressive and intuitive for non-technical users and they often
                produce better results for photorealistic and cinematic scenes, However, they can be too verbose or
                vague if not structured well.

                Style-Based Prompts: Focus on a Specific Style
            </h2>
            <p>
                Style-based prompts are prompts that emphasize a specific visual style, medium, or aesthetics. They are
                used to mimic artists, genres, or media types. They contain words such as <i>“oil painting”</i> or
                <i>“in the
                    style of [artist]”</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                An example of a style-based prompt would be: <em class="prompt">“An oil painting portrait of a beautiful
                    adult woman with
                    long black hair, in the style of Leonardo da Vinci”</em>. This would generate an image similar to
                the one
                below.
            </p>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/portrait-woman-leonardo-da-vinci.jpg"
                    alt="An oil painting portrait of a woman by Leonardo da Vinci" />
                <figcaption>
                    An oil painting portrait of a beautiful adult woman with long black hair, in the style of Leonardo
                    da Vinci
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                We would get a different image if we were to change the style to that of Rembrandt, as follows: <em
                    class="prompt">“An oil
                    painting portrait of a beautiful adult woman with long black hair, in the style of Rembrandt”</em>
            </p>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/portrait-woman-rembrandt.jpg" alt="An oil painting portrait of a woman by Rembrandt" />
                <figcaption>
                    An oil painting portrait of a beautiful adult woman with long black hair, in the style of Rembrandt
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Style-based prompts add artistic flair and consistency to the image output. However, they may also
                override some visual elements in the prompt because the artistic style takes precedence over any other
                keyword.

                Parameterized Prompts: Emphasis on Important Words
            </h2>
            <p>
                Parameterized prompts are prompts that emphasize certain words or sections by weighing them using the
                following pattern: <strong>“(word:weight)”</strong>. The parentheses highlight the word; and the weight
                specifies its
                relative importance. The weight uses a decimal format that starts at an implicit value of <i>“1.0”</i>;
                with
                <i>“1.1”</i> meaning <i>“10% more important than other words”</i>, <i>“1.2”</i> meaning <i>“20% more
                    important than other
                    words”</i>, and so on. Examples of such weighed words are <i>“(long hair:1.1)”</i> or <i>“(school
                    uniform:1.2)”</i>. In
                these examples, both <i>“long hair”</i> and <i>“school uniform”</i> will be more important than other
                words in the
                prompt; however, <i>“school uniform”</i> will be given higher priority over <i>“long hair”</i> because
                it has a
                greater weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Parameterized prompts give more control over what the model should emphasize. They are usually used in
                combination with other prompt types, especially keyword-based prompts. In fact, the previous
                keyword-based prompt example could be rewritten as follows: <em class="prompt">“1girl, (long hair:1.1),
                    (school
                    uniform:1.2), looking at viewer, cherry blossom, detailed eyes”</em>. This would generate an image
                similar to
                the one below:
            </p>
            <figure class="image-output">
                <img src="images/young-asian-girl-in-uniform-parameterized.png"

                </figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Parameterized prompts provide fine-tuned control over prompt strength. However, they require a deeper
                knowledge of the behavior of the model being used, which usually requires extra work and/or research.
            </p>

                A Recipe for Effective Image Prompts
            </h2>
            <p>
                In general, I recommend the following template for writing effective prompts:
            </p>
            <p class="prompt-recipe">
                A [subject] [action] [environment or location], [lighting], [art style], masterpiece, best quality,
                highly detailed
            </p>
            <p>
                Let&apos;s review each component in detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, the subject is the main actor in the image. Use clear nouns and modifiers when describing it. For
                example, you can write <em class="prompt">“A young asian girl”</em>, <em class="prompt">“A red sports
                    car”</em>, <em class="prompt">“A futuristic robot with humanoid
                    shape”</em>, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, the action is what the subject is doing. Use dynamic elements or storytelling hints to describe
                it. Some examples include <em class="prompt">“walking on the beach”</em>, <em class="prompt">“dancing in
                    the rain”</em>, <em class="prompt">“driving on a desert street”</em>, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third, the environment describes the context or location of the image. Be as specific as possible when
                describing it. For instance, use words such as <em class="prompt">“inside an old church”</em>, <em
                    class="prompt">“on a tropical island”</em>, <em class="prompt">“in post-apocalyptic San
                    Francisco”</em>, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fourth, the lighting sets the mood and provides the emotional tone of the image. Use words that evoke
                such feelings. Examples include <em class="prompt">“soft light”</em>, <em class="prompt">“in morning
                    light”</em>, <em class="prompt">“cinematic lighting”</em>, <em class="prompt">“foggy winter
                    morning”</em>, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, the artistic style guides the overall visual treatment of the image. You can use common
                keywords such as <em class="prompt">“anime”</em>, <em class="prompt">“digital painting”</em>, or <em
                    class="prompt">“photorealistic”</em>. You can also use artistic reference words such as <em
                    class="prompt">“in the style of [artist]”</em>. Experiment with different styles until you find the
                most appropriate one for your image.

                For portraits. I recommend the following template:
            </p>
            <p class="prompt-recipe">
                (masterpiece, best quality), portrait of [subject], [specific features], highly detailed eyes, highly
                detailed skin, skin pores, professional lighting, dslr, ultra quality, sharp focus, depth of field,
                Fujifilm XT3
            </p>
            <p>
                Put together, those templates result in the following outstanding AI images.

                Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                In conclusion, prompt engineering is more than just typing words into a box; it&apos;s a creative
                process
                that blends imagination, language, and visual thinking. The way you write your prompts affects the image
                output. By understanding the different types of prompts and experimenting with structure, detail, and
                style, you can unlock the full potential of AI models like Stable Diffusion. So follow the
                recommendations that I&apos;ve provided in this article, experiment with different prompt types, combine
                them, enrich them with your own style, and push them to the limits of your creativity. To master the art
                of prompt engineering, just remember that, when it comes to AI-generated art, the prompt is your brush,
                and the model is your canvas.
